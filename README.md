angular-quartz-cron ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RajanRastogi/angular-quartz-cron.svg?branch=master) 
===================

This is based on [Jacob Carter's](https://github.com/jacobscarter) project [angular-cron-jobs](https://github.com/jacobscarter/angular-cron-jobs) but provides us the [Quartz](https://quartz-scheduler.org/) compatible cron instead of the classic cron syntax.

### Update:
All the capabilities of this project have been merged into the [angular-cron-jobs](https://github.com/jacobscarter/angular-cron-jobs) project, which adds a lot of features to the module. I would highly recommend using the `angular-cron-jobs` module over this one.

### Demo:

Play around with the [demo](http://rajanrastogi.github.io/angular-quartz-cron/#/).

### Installation:

You can easily get the project using `bower`.

```
bower install angular-quartz-cron
```

### Usage:

Include the component in the app:

```
    angular.module('my-app', ['angular-quartz-cron'])
```

Insert the directive:
```
    <quartz-cron-selection></quartz-cron-selection>
```

You can interact with the directive using the following attributes:

* output
* init(optional)
* template(optional)
* config(optional)

#### output
Binds the output cron generated by this directive to the provided variable.

#### init
Lets you initialize the UI based on the cron string provided. It can be set after the directive has loaded. 

#### template
Lets you use custom templates. It should be set to the url of the custom template you are trying to use.

#### config
This is an object in your controller you can use to remove options from the user.  For example if you would like the user to be able to set Minute, Hour, and Day but not Week, Month, and Year you would create the following object in your controller:

    $scope.myConfig = {
        options: {
            allowWeek : false,
            allowMonth : false,
            allowYear : false
        }
    }

Currently the config object accepts an options property with an object of allowed selections.  These include:

* allowMinute
* allowHour
* allowDay
* allowWeek
* allowMonth
* allowYear

Setting the keys as booleans will turn the selection on and off.
